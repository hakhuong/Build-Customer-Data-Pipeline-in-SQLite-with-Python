# Create-customer-database-in-SQLite-with-Python

This is a Date Pipeline created to import the Cutomer Data File and Sales data. This program will write the data into a new Sqlite3 database and execute data from there. 

- This pipeline can import the daily transaction data given a date range as input in the commandline
    - Users can add new customers to the database
    - Users can add additional sales to the database
    - Users should be able to run this overall program for 1 day, 2 days or 3 days.
    - Users may have additional datasets to run against as well with missing days in between

- Once the data is imported, data is used to answer these following requests:
    - Cleaned and scrubed as required
    - Identify the Top 5 customers based on spending
    - Identify the Top 3 products being sold
    - Daily trend of sales per products (data and graph)
    - Daily trend of sales per customer (data and graph)
    - Average sales per day by product (qty) (data and Graph)
    - Average sales per day by $(data and Graph)
    - Average sales per day by customer on spending (data and Graph)
